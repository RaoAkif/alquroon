      It is responsibility of Muslim parents to impart authentic Islamic
      knowledge in their children. Proper recitation, by following the Tajweed
      rules, Tafseer, and Holy Hadith are the tools to make a child, a
      knowledgeable Muslim. It is hard to find good source of religious
      knowledge in Non-Muslim states. Therefore, online Quran teaching has
      become the most feasible way for this.
